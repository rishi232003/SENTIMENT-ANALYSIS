# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
This project compares sentiment analysis performance across three NLP models: VADER, RoBERTa, and a Logistic Regression TF IDF model that I built. Using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, I show how modern machine learning and transformer based models outperform rule based approaches, particularly on larger datasets.
